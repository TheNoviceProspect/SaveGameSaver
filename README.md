# SaveGameSaver
A simple backup solution for locally installed save games. (Useful for things like early access branches etc)

## (Naming Conventions)

- `α` = (alpha) <= This software is NOT ready for public consumption!
  > (Please don't report any bugs here!)
- `β` = (beta) <= This software is ready for testing.
  > (This is your time to shine! Report gremlins and bugs! Oh, and, **DON'T FEED THEM AFTER MIDNIGHT!**)
- `ω` = (omega) <- This is a "point" release (Meaning everything *should* be working)
  > (DUDE! Get in touch with me if something went wrong!)

## TODO

 - Implement Recovery
 - Implement backup naming based on *either* date **or** time (The difference between a daily backup and up to 10 backups in the same day)
 - Allow change of MaxBackups (which would also affect the previous todo)
